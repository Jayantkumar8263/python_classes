'''Write a Python program that reads two integers representing a month and day and prints the season for that month and day.
Expected Output:

Input the month (e.g. January, February etc.): july                     
Input the day: 31                                                       
Season is autumn.
'''
x = int(input("number of month [1-12]:"))               
y = int(input("number of days[1-30] :"))
if x >= 4 and x<=6 and y <=31:
    print("season is summer")
elif x == (7-9) and y <= 31 ():
    print("season is ")
